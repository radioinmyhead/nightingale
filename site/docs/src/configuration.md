# Configuration

Nightingale stores app settings in `~/.nightingale/config.json`.

## Data Storage

During setup, you can choose a custom data folder. Most runtime data lives in that selected folder. In v0.8.0, cache, videos, models, and vendor tools can also move into separate folders from the settings page. `config.json` and `nightingale.log` remain in the default `~/.nightingale` path.

Typical selected data folder layout:

```
<selected-data-folder>/
├── cache/               # Stems, transcripts, lyrics, shifted variants, covers, playable videos
├── songs.db             # Song library and analysis metadata (SQLite)
├── profiles.json        # Player profiles and scores
├── videos/              # Cached Pixabay video backgrounds
├── sounds/              # Sound effects
├── vendor/
│   ├── ffmpeg           # Downloaded ffmpeg binary
│   ├── uv               # Downloaded uv binary
│   ├── python/          # Python 3.10 installed via uv
│   ├── venv/            # Virtual environment with ML packages
│   ├── analyzer/        # Extracted analyzer Python scripts
│   └── .ready           # Marker indicating setup is complete
└── models/
    ├── torch/           # Demucs model cache
    ├── huggingface/     # WhisperX model cache
    └── audio_separator/ # UVR Karaoke model cache
```

## Video Backgrounds

Pixabay video backgrounds use the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/). In development, create a `.env` file at the project root with:

```
PIXABAY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Theme

Toggle between dark and light themes from the sidebar. The theme preference is saved in the config.

## Network Proxy

Setup downloads (Python, PyTorch, ML models, ffmpeg, uv) come from GitHub, PyPI, and Hugging Face. If those are slow or unreachable from your network, you can route all downloads through an HTTP(S) proxy.

There is no Settings UI for this — quit the app, then add a `proxy` key to `~/.nightingale/config.json`:

```json
{
  "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
}
```

On the next launch, Nightingale exports the standard proxy environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and their lowercase variants) for its own process before any downloads start, so both in-app downloads and the analyzer subprocess (uv, pip, model downloads) go through the proxy. Environment variables that are already set take precedence, and nothing is exported when the key is absent or empty.

This is mainly useful for GUI launches, where shell profile exports (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) don't apply.

## Notable Settings

`config.json` is written by the app — you'll usually change these from **Settings** rather than by editing the file directly. In v0.8.0, settings moved from a modal into a dedicated page with **General** and **Analysis** tabs. A few keys worth knowing:

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `asr_engine` | Selects the transcription engine. `whisper` (default) or `parakeet`. See [Lyrics & Transcription](./lyrics.md#choosing-the-asr-engine). |
| `align_backend` | Forced-alignment backend. `whisperx` (default, Python Viterbi), `ctc` (torchaudio `forced_align` C++/CUDA kernel; faster), or `qwen` (Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B; 11 languages incl. CJK, runs on CUDA/MPS/CPU). All non-default backends fall back to WhisperX on error or unsupported input. See [Lyrics & Transcription](./lyrics.md#choosing-the-forced-alignment-backend). |
| `separator` | Stem separation model: `karaoke` (UVR, default) or `demucs`. |
| `vocal_detection_threshold_pct` | RMS threshold (fraction of the loudest window, `0.0`–`1.0`, default `0.15`) that marks where vocals start and end. Lower values keep more quiet intros/outros and soft singing; higher values trim more silence. Shown in Settings as **Vocal detection sensitivity** (0–60%). |
| `whisper_model` | Whisper model size: `large-v3` (default), `large-v3-turbo`, `medium`, `small`, `base`, `tiny`. Ignored when `asr_engine` is `parakeet`. |
| `beam_size` / `batch_size` | Decoder beam width and batch size for Whisper. Higher values are more accurate but slower and use more VRAM. |
| `mic_monitor_gain` | Live monitor gain when mic monitoring is on. Range `0.0`–`2.0` (slider shown as 0–200%). Configs from older builds that used `mic_mirror_gain` are read transparently and migrated on next save. |
| `mic_latency_compensation_sec` | Speaker-to-mic latency compensation for pitch scoring. Tune manually or use the Settings latency test. |
| `mic_active` / `mic_monitoring` / `preferred_mic` | Microphone state and the device chosen for scoring + monitoring. Older `mic_mirroring` configs are accepted and migrated on next save. |
| `lyrics_vertical_position` / `lyrics_horizontal_position` | Playback lyrics placement. Vertical: `top`, `center`, `bottom`; horizontal: `left`, `center`, `right`. |
| `auto_analyze` | When `true`, scans automatically queue every unanalyzed song after they finish. |
| `cache_paths` | Optional per-folder overrides for `songs`, `videos`, `models`, and `vendor`. Use Settings to move them so existing contents migrate safely. |
| `last_video_flavor` | Index of the last-used Pixabay video flavor (Nature, Underwater, Space, City, Countryside). |
| `last_theme` | Index of the last-used playback background (shaders → video → source). |
| `language_overrides` | Per-song forced ASR language, keyed by song hash. Set this from the song-list controls. |
| `proxy` | Optional HTTP(S) proxy URL (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:7890`) applied to all downloads at startup. No Settings UI — edit the file while the app is closed. See [Network Proxy](#network-proxy). |
| `data_path` | Selected data folder root. Set during first-run setup. |
